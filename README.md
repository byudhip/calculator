Calculator by Yudhi Pratama

This calculator was done to fulfill The Odin Project final assignment in the Foundations Course. It can perform basic mathematical calculation, using decimals/float, percentage, negative number, and has several built-in alerts and preventions in case of large number operations, attempts for double operator, double percentage, number after percentage, and many more.

Update:
After 30 something commits, I can proudly say this calculator is feature complete. It can catch all possible edge cases I can think of, and has refined prevention for "illegal" operations such as adding minus sign to 0, pressing % while text is 0, etc, adding operator consecutively, etc. Visually, it's also finished. Color palette was Cyberpunk 2077 themed, but the final result looks more Borderlands due to thin black border surrounding its elements. I am very happy with the result, and can't wait to do other projects!
