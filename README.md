Calculator by Yudhi Pratama

This calculator was done to fulfill The Odin Project final assignment in the Foundations Course. It can perform basic mathematical calculation, using decimals/float, percentage, negative number, and has several built-in alerts and preventions in case of large number operations, attempts for double operator, double percentage, number after percentage, and many more. It is almost done, and I'm currently smoothing out the details of this project.
